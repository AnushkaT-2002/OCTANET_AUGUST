(The images used in the page are taken from the internet and i have no intentions of copyright infringement)
For the first week task, I have created a landing page of an e-commerce website named "Office Solutions" which deals with all office requirements.
Initialyy HTML and CSS is used for task-1. I have added a header which includes certain buttons and features. Another button for shop is provided along with a search bar for 
products. Then certain broad categories of products is displayed in rectangular boxes. At the end a footer is added.
